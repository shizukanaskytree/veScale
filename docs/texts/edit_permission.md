The permission error you're encountering when trying to edit files outside of the Docker runtime is likely due to the file ownership being set to a different user within the Docker container, causing your host system user to lack the necessary permissions to modify the file.

Here’s how you can solve this issue:

### Option 1: Set the Correct User Permissions
1. **Identify the User and Group IDs:**
   Inside your Docker container, identify the User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) of the files you're working with:
   ```bash
   ls -l run.sh
   ```
   This will show the UID and GID associated with the file.

2. **Change File Ownership:**
   You can change the ownership of the files to match your host system's user ID and group ID. For example, if your host system’s UID is 1000 and GID is 1000, you can use:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /data/xiaofengwu/vescale_prj/veScale/examples/nanogpt_4D_finetune/run_scripts/run.sh
   ```
   Replace `1000:1000` with the actual UID and GID of your host system user.

3. **Adjust Docker Container Settings:**
   When starting your Docker container, you can specify the UID and GID to match your host user:
   ```bash
   docker run -u $(id -u):$(id -g) ...
   ```
   This ensures that files created inside the container will have the correct ownership.

### Option 2: Use Docker Volumes with Correct Permissions
1. **Mount Volumes with the Correct User:**
   When you mount a volume into your Docker container, you can specify the user permissions. For example:
   ```bash
   docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container:rw -u $(id -u):$(id -g) ...
   ```
   This will mount the volume with read-write permissions and ensure that files created in the container can be edited outside.

2. **Set Permissions Inside Docker Container:**
   You can also set permissions inside the container by running:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /path/in/container
   ```
   This changes the ownership of the directory and its contents to your current user.

### Option 3: Modify Files Using a Docker User
1. **Create or Modify the User in Docker:**
   If you frequently encounter this issue, consider creating or modifying a user in the Dockerfile that matches your host system's user:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu
   RUN useradd -u $(id -u) -m myuser
   USER myuser
   ```
   This will ensure that any files created in the container will have the correct permissions on the host system.

### Option 4: Use `chmod` to Adjust File Permissions
If you don't want to change the ownership, you can adjust the file permissions to allow your host user to edit them:
```bash
sudo chmod 777 /data/xiaofengwu/vescale_prj/veScale/examples/nanogpt_4D_finetune/run_scripts/run.sh
```
This approach is less secure but allows anyone to edit the file.

By implementing one of these solutions, you should be able to resolve the permission errors you're encountering when editing files outside of the Docker runtime.
