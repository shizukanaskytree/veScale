To create Python code that generates a series of log files documenting the step-by-step execution of a function, you need to describe the requirements clearly and comprehensively. Here's a detailed description that you can use to ask ChatGPT to help you create the Python code:

### Objective:
The goal is to generate a series of log files that document each step of the execution of a Python function. Each log file should capture the state of the function at a specific point in its execution, including the code being executed and the state of the variables at that point. This is particularly important for tracking the changes in variables during loops.

### Function Example:

It preserves and prints all the variables associated with each executed line up to the current step, we’ll enhance the logging functionality to accumulate and display the variables of all executed lines in the function. This means that each log file will not only display the variables for the current line but also show the variables for all lines that have been executed so far.

Consider the following function as an example:

```python
def example_function():
    x = 0
    for i in range(3):
        x += i
    return x
```

### Log Files:

Each log file will represent a single step of the function's execution. The log files will contain:

1. **The Full Function Code**: Displayed with line numbers.
2. **Highlighted Executed Line**: The line that was just executed will be highlighted (e.g., with an asterisk `*`).
3. **Variables Below the Executed Line**: The variables affected by the executed line will be displayed immediately below that line. If the line is executed multiple times (such as in a loop), each execution will append the variable values to the previous ones.

### Example Log Files:

1. **Log File: `step_001.log`**
   - Line 2 is executed, initializing `x = 0`.
   - The log file shows the function code, with the variable `x` displayed below line 2.

   ```plaintext
     1: def example_function():
     2:     x = 0
            -----
            x = 0
            -----
     3:     for i in range(3):
     4:         x += i
     5:     return x
   ```

2. **Log File: `step_002.log`**
   - Line 3 is executed for the first iteration of the loop, initializing `i = 0`.
   - The log file shows the function code, with the variable `i` displayed below line 3.

   ```plaintext
     1: def example_function():
     2:     x = 0
            -----
            x = 0
            -----
     3:     for i in range(3):
            -----
            i = 0
            -----
     4:         x += i
     5:     return x
   ```

3. **Log File: `step_003.log`**
   - Line 4 is executed during the first iteration of the loop, where `x` is updated to `0` (since `x = 0 + i`, and `i = 0`).
   - The log file shows the function code, with the updated `x` and `i` displayed below line 4.

   ```plaintext
     1: def example_function():
     2:     x = 0
            -----
            x = 0
            -----
     3:     for i in range(3):
            -----
            i = 0
            -----
     4:         x += i
                ------------
                x = 0, i = 0
                ------------
     5:     return x
   ```

4. **Log File: `step_004.log`**
   - Line 3 is executed again for the second iteration of the loop, initializing `i = 1`.
   - The log file shows the function code, with the updated `i` value appended below line 3.

   ```plaintext
     1: def example_function():
     2:     x = 0
            -----
            x = 0
            -----
     3:     for i in range(3):
            -----
            i = 0
            i = 1
            -----
     4:         x += i
                ------------
                x = 0, i = 0
                ------------
     5:     return x
   ```

5. **Log File: `step_005.log`**
   - Line 4 is executed during the second iteration of the loop, where `x` is updated to `1` (since `x = 0 + i`, and `i = 1`).
   - The log file shows the function code, with the updated `x` and `i` displayed below line 4.

   ```plaintext
     1: def example_function():
     2:     x = 0
            -----
            x = 0
            -----
     3:     for i in range(3):
            -----
            i = 0
            i = 1
            -----
     4:         x += i
                ------------
                x = 0, i = 0
                x = 1, i = 1
                ------------
     5:     return x
   ```

### Additional Requirements:
- **Variable Persistence**: The variables for each line should be persisted across iterations. When a line is executed multiple times, such as within a loop, the variable values should be appended below the previous ones, creating a history of variable changes.
- **Function Call Identification**: The function’s name and the line where it starts should be identified and used to extract the function's code.
- **Readable Log Format**: The log files should be formatted for readability, with clear separation between the code, the executed line, and the variables.

### Summary:
This approach will create a detailed, step-by-step log of the function's execution, documenting the changes to variables in a format that is easy to read and understand. Each log file will correspond to a specific step in the execution, allowing for a clear understanding of how the function operates and how the variables evolve during its execution.


Implementation:

To implement this, you can use the provided LogParser and ExecutionTracker classes with modifications to generate these log files.

	1.	Extend the LogParser: Modify the LogParser class to generate a new log file for each step in the parsed log, formatting the content as described above.
	2.	Track Variable Changes: Ensure that variables are tracked and appended correctly across multiple executions of the same line.
	3.	Generate Log Files: For each step, create a log file (e.g., step_001.log, step_002.log) with the function code, the highlighted executed line, and the variables.

This approach will help you create a detailed, step-by-step log of a function’s execution, documenting how variables change over time in a format that is easy to understand.
